**The ultimate guide to creating games with Unity and Microsoft Game Stack**

## What is this book about?
As one of the most widely used game engines in the world, **Unity** provides easy-to-use and powerful game development tools, which undoubtedly attracts many developers to choose it to develop their own games. However, the tools needed in modern game development are not limited to game engines; other tools and services such as the **cloud** are increasingly used in game development. In this book, we will explore how to use the **Unity game engine** and the **Microsoft Game Dev**, including the **Microsoft Azure Cloud** and **Microsoft Azure PlayFab** services, to create games.

## Basic Unity Concepts

Starting by understanding the fundamentals of the Unity game engine, you will gradually become familiar with the Unity Editor and the key concepts of writing Unity scripts in C#, which will get you ready to make your own game.
Then, you‚Äôll learn how to work with Unity‚Äôs built-in modules, such as the **UI** system, **Animation** system, **Physics** system, and how to integrate **video and audio** in your game to make your game more interesting.
